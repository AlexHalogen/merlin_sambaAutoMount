# merlin_sambaAutoMount

This script share ONLY root directories of mounted usb partitions in samba.

Put these scripts to /jffs/scripts to automatically run them after a new usb drive is mounted / one or more drives are unmounted.

By default it grant access to admin. Change post-mount to add or change users.

I do not hold responsibility for any unresponsive routers or damaged hardware. Use the script at your own risk.
